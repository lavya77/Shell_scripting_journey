What is Linux Shell?

A shell provide an environment to a user to a execute commands  and interact with a kernel.

There are different types of shell
1.bash
2.sh
3.ksh
4.tsh
5.fish
6.zsh

Bash is commonly used shell.

SOME THINGS YOU CAN DO BEFORE STARTING OFF:

You can check your shell type using "echo $0".
you can also check your os distro in os-release which is in etc/os-release.
To check that other shells are supported in your terminal or not , go to etc/shells.

What is shell scripting?
Shell script consits of set of commands to perform a task.All the commands execute sequentially.Tasks like file manipulation,program execution, user interactions, automation of tasks can be done.

#!/bin/bash - what does this means??

(#!)- Shebang or hashbang
syntax: #!/path/to/interpreter
We use shebang at the very top of a script file to tell the operating system which interpreter should be used to execute that script.
/path/to/interpreter - is the absolute path to the program that should interpret the file.
#!/bin/bash - tells the OS to use Bash shell to execute the script.

HOW TO RUN A SCRIPT??

make sure script has execute permissions "rwx".
Run using :
./script.sh
/path/script.sh
bash script.sh

Now lets first come to permissions,how to check which permissions your script has?
using -> "ls -ltr".
now you might be seeing something in form of r w or x if js sarted off maybe r w.
so ,
r -> Read
w -> Write
x -> Execute

and they apply to three groups :
 u -> users(owner)
 g -> groups
 o -> others

For example: rw- r-- r--
rw- -> owners can read and write.
r-- -> group can only read.
r-- -> others can only read.

No x means it cannot be execurted.
how to make it executable?
using chmod(change mode).
chmod +x myscript.sh

SOME COMMON SETTINGS:

chmod +x file -> add execute permissions for everyone.
chmod u+x file -> add execute permissions on;y for owner.
chmod 755 file -> owner can read write and execute . others can only read and execute.
chmod 700 file -> Only owner can read write and execute(private script).
